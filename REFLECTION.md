This assignment was a nice introduction to git and GitHub. The markup language and commands used for git are still difficult to grasp because the resulting actions are not immediate as they are in JS. This assignment was helpful in getting me more comfortable in the VSCode environment as well.
The function building was nice to put to practice the various ways of creating functions. Also I used this as an oportunnity to explore different approaches to the same solution ie, recursion vs loops.
I imagine Git is a incredible resource for team projects through the use of branches and merging. Also as an individual, it would be helpful as a way to manage larger projects by dividing tasks into branches etc.
